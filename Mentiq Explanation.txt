Feature 1: Dashboards
Dashboards are the central control panel where founders, product managers, and success teams can see all the signals that matter for retention and churn. They pull in multiple streams of product, account, and financial data, and visualize them in one view.
Here’s the breakdown of each metric tracked, how it’s calculated, and what it reveals.

1. Location
●	What it is: Geographical distribution of users/accounts.

●	How we track it:

○	Captured via IP address or browser/device locale at login.

○	Stored in user profile metadata.

●	Why it matters:

○	Certain markets may show higher retention or adoption.

○	Helps guide localization or region-specific churn strategies.

2. Device
●	What it is: The type of device used (desktop, mobile, tablet, OS).

●	How we track it:

○	Captured from browser agent string or SDK

●	Why it matters:

○	Friction can be device-specific (e.g., mobile bugs leading to churn).

○	Optimizations can focus on devices with high churn.


3. Adoption Metrics
●	What it is: How much of the product’s core features are being used.

●	How we track it:

○	Define “Core Features” (e.g., Feature A, Feature B).

○	Adoption Rate (%) = (Users who engaged with a feature at least once ÷ Total active users) × 100
○	Track both individual feature adoption and % of users adopting all key features.

●	Why it matters:

○	Lack of adoption = future churn.

○	Feature-specific drop-offs show where onboarding fails.


4. Engagement Metrics
●	What it is: Frequency and depth of user interactions.

●	Metrics + Formulas:

○	DAU (Daily Active Users): Count of unique users active in the last 24h.

○	WAU (Weekly Active Users): Count of unique users active in the last 7 days.

○	MAU (Monthly Active Users): Count of unique users active in the last 30 days.

○	Stickiness Ratio = DAU ÷ MAU → Measures habit strength (e.g., 0.3 = users log in 30% of days).

○	Session Frequency = Avg. number of sessions per user per day/week/month.

○	Session Length = Avg. duration (login → logout, or activity start → end).

●	How we track it:

○	Event stream timestamps.

○	Sessionization logic (grouping events until inactivity >30 mins).

●	Why it matters:

○	Drop in frequency/length = churn risk.

○	Stickiness is a direct measure of product-market fit.


5. Retention
●	What it is: How many users stick around over time.

●	Formulas:

○	Classic Retention (Day N) = (Users active on Day N ÷ Users who signed up on Day 0) × 100
○	Rolling Retention (Day N) = % of users active on or after Day N.

○	Cohort Retention: Group users by signup week/month → track retention curves.

●	How we track it:

○	Cohort analysis engine (signup date + activity logs).

●	Why it matters:

○	Reveals how sticky the product is beyond the honeymoon period.







6. Conversion
●	What it is: Movement from free trial → paid, or lower-tier → higher-tier.

●	Formulas:

○	Trial-to-Paid Conversion Rate = (Number of trial users converted to paid ÷ Total trial users) × 100
○	Upgrade Rate = (Number of accounts upgrading to higher tier ÷ Total accounts eligible) × 100
●	How we track it:

○	Billing integrations (Stripe, Paddle, etc.) + signup metadata.

●	Why it matters:

○	Weak conversion funnels = revenue leakage + churn risk.


7. Churn
●	What it is: Rate at which users/customers cancel or stop engaging.

●	Types:

○	Customer Churn Rate = (Customers lost in period ÷ Customers at start of period) × 100
○	Revenue Churn Rate (MRR Churn) = (MRR lost in period – MRR gained from upgrades) ÷ MRR at start of period × 100
●	How we track it:

○	Billing system (for revenue churn).

○	Activity signals (for engagement churn).

●	Why it matters:

○	This is the North Star metric for retention SaaS.



8. Revenue
●	What it is: Money earned by account tiers, plans, and usage.

●	Metrics:

○	MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) = Sum of all active subscriptions in a given month.

○	ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) = MRR × 12.

○	ARPU (Avg. Revenue Per User) = Total MRR ÷ Active Paying Users.

○	Expansion Revenue = Upgrades + Add-ons.

●	How we track it:

○	Pulled directly from billing integrations (Stripe, Recurly, etc.).

●	Why it matters:

○	Connects churn → actual dollars lost.

○	Helps prioritize where to focus retention fixes.
